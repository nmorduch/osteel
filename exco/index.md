The **Steel Drum ExCo** is offered every semester to interested college and conservatory students. Non-students are sometimes (but rarely) accepted, depending on space. We can only accept about 20 students and often over 80 apply, so applicants should not expect to get in on your first try. To apply, stop by our table at the ExCo fair, meet the current semester’s teachers, and fill out a short application. No experience is necessary! We try to select people with a diverse range of musical backgrounds.

Taught by two or three members of Oberlin Steel, the ExCo is more of an ensemble than a class; we teach fundamentals of playing the steel pan as well as the history of the instrument. We meet once a week for two hours, with additional practice time required. The class is graded pass/no pass for one co-curricular credit hour. At the end of the semester, interested students are encouraged to audition for Oberlin Steel. Taking the ExCo is the only pathway to joining the band.

It’s always a lot of fun!

**Sign up at the ExCo fair in the Carnegie Root Room during the first week of each semester.**
