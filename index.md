Oberlin Steel (OSteel) is based at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. Formed around 1980 and known as "The Oberlin Can Consortium" until 2001, the group performs at campus events and in the Oberlin area. It also goes on an annual tour over the week of spring break in late March; past destinations include New York, Boston, New Orleans, Montreal, Miami, Atlanta, and Washington D.C. This year the band toured Kentucky and Tennessee, playing shows in Louisville, Memphis, Nashville, and Short Mountain. Help us with our [upcoming trip]({{ site.baseurl }}/trip)!

The band usually has 12-18 members, including tenor, double tenor, seconds, cello, quads, and bass pan players, as well as auxiliary percussionists and a set drummer. The group plays in the tradition of the great steel bands of Trinidad, but also performs arrangements of salsa, calypso, and jazz tunes as well as original compositions and arrangements by band members.

Oberlin Steel has made six recordings in recent years. Check out the new one just released this spring: [Welcome to the Swanktuary]({{ site.baseurl }}/albums/welcome-to-the-swanktuary).
