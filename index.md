Oberlin Steel (OSteel) is based at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. Formed around 1980 and known as "The Oberlin Can Consortium" until 2001, the group performs at campus events and in the Oberlin area. Osteel also goes on an annual tour over the week of spring break in late March; past destinations include New York, New Orleans, Montreal, Miami, Atlanta, Washington D.C., Louisville, Nashville, Austin, and Short Mountain, TN.

The band usually has 16-21 members, including tenor, double tenor, seconds, cello, quads, and bass pan players, as well as auxiliary percussionists and a set drummer. The group plays in the soca tradition of the great steelbands of Trinidad, but also performs arrangements of calypso, jazz, salsa, and pop tunes, many arranged by band members.

Oberlin Steel has made four recordings in recent years. [Welcome to the Swanktuary]({{ site.baseurl }}/albums/welcome-to-the-swanktuary) was recorded in Spring of 2012. "Plenty Vibes," recorded May 2014-April 2015, was released in Spring 2016. Please send questions and CD requests to osteel@oberlin.edu.
