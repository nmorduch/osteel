## Booking Info

OSteel plays primarily Trinidadian calypso and soca tunes, up-tempo and extremely danceable. Despite being a large group, OSteel can easily downsize to fit almost any space and requires no sound assistance. The band has performed in venues ranging from concert halls and open-air markets to tiny nightclubs.

The bandâ€™s current gig coordinator is Eliot Hart-Nelson. If you would like to book the band, please contact us at [osteel@oberlin.edu](mailto:osteel@oberlin.edu).
