This January, OSteel will travel to Trinidad to perform in the famous Panorama competition as a part of Birdsong Steel Orchestra! Our goals for the trip include:

- Growing as musicians and performers.
- Acquiring pan-playing techniques, rehearsal practices, and band management skills that can be integrated into OSteel upon returning to Oberlin.
- Establishing personal meaning and connection with an event that is integral to the modern pan world, as well as developing a greater understanding of what Panorama means to Trinidad and to the international pan community.
- Learning about the history and culture of Trinidad and of the steel pan.
- Bringing our new knowledge back to Oberlin to share with our bi-annual Steel Drum ExCo class and the greater Oberlin community.

But we need your help! We've raised enough money to bring this adventure to fruition in its most basic form, which is incredible! We reached this point through the generous donations of contributors to our Indiegogo campaign, as well as other sources. But we still need some additional funds to add exciting activities to our itinerary like workshops with professional pan players. Please help us by donating to our next fundraising campaign, this time through Oberlin's new crowdsurfing project, through the link below:
