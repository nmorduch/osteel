This January, OSteel will travel to Trinidad to perform in the famous Panorama competition as a part of Birdsong Steel Orchestra! Our goals for the trip include:

- Growing as musicians and performers.
- Acquiring pan-playing techniques, rehearsal practices, and band management skills that can be integrated into OSteel upon returning to Oberlin.
- Establishing personal meaning and connection with an event that is integral to the modern pan world, as well as developing a greater understanding of what Panorama means to Trinidad and to the international pan community.
- Learning about the history and culture of Trinidad and of the steel pan.
- Bringing our new knowledge back to Oberlin to share with our bi-annual Steel Drum ExCo class and the greater Oberlin community.

But we need your help! We're currently in the midst of a giant fundraising pushâ€”if we don't raise enough money, we won't be able to bring this exciting and educational adventure to fruition. Please help us by donating to our Indiegogo fundraising campaign through the link below:
